# stratmat
Stratmat is a prototype strategy sandbox for FFXIV.

The goal is to produce something similar to [Raidplan.io](https://raidplan.io/) or [Toolbox](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/) but geared specifically towards advanced use for FFXIV.

A full list of planned features:

1. **Accuracy**: Accurately reflect the size and position of AoEs, rather than guessing.
1. **Pre-Coded Fights**: Fight mechanics and timelines will be coded directly into the app.
1. **Fight Mechanic Support**: Code fight mechanics to show if a strat will work correctly or not.
1. **Real-Time Playback**: Watch a strat or entire fight resolve in real time.
1. **Fight Timeline Organization**: Organize an entire fight on a single page, no more need for a pastebin with separate strats for each mechanic.
1. **Strat Sharing**: Build a new fight timeline by cobbling from existing ones.
1. **RNG Support**: Support variations on a mechanic based on different RNG. Ability to visualize any variation correctly.
1. **Quizzing**: Check your understanding of a strat by drilling where you should stand in response to a given mechanic.
1. **Margin of Error**: Automatically compute how much space or time someone has to work with for a particular strat.
1. **Customizability**: Replace icons to match your team comp, include enemry signs if desired.
1. **Variations**: Support for variations on a strat based on party comp or minor variations (e.g. invuln/no-invuln).
1. :white_check_mark: **Waymark Export**: Compatibility with the Waymark Preset Plugin.

Stratmat is written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) using the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine.
